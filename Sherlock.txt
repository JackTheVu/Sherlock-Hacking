                        file.
  --tor, -t             Make requests over Tor; increases runtime; requires Tor to be installed and
                        in system path.
  --unique-tor, -u      Make requests over Tor with new Tor circuit after each request; increases
                        runtime; requires Tor to be installed and in system path.
  --csv                 Create Comma-Separated Values (CSV) File.
  --site SITE_NAME      Limit analysis to just the listed sites. Add multiple options to specify
                        more than one site.
  --proxy PROXY_URL, -p PROXY_URL

  --timeout TIMEOUT     Time (in seconds) to wait for response to requests. Default timeout is
                        infinity. A longer timeout will be more likely to get results from slow
                        sites. On the other hand, this may cause a long delay to gather all results.
  --print-all           Output sites where the username was not found.
  --print-found         Output sites where the username was found.
  --no-color            Don't color terminal output
